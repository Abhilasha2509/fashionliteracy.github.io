NIFT group discussion is followed by the personal interview on the same day as
GD. PI process generally takes 5-15 minutes per person and the panel consists
of 2-3 members. 

The questions are asked from various fields viz educational
background, past experience, fashion aptitude, general awareness, career
orientation. 

You are not allowed to take any paper (even the biodata or
portfolio) inside the PI room. It is rather a comfortable environment inside so
there is no need to panic.

Some of the questions similar to those asked in the NIFT PI (Personal
Interview) are.

1) Tell your educational background.  
2) Why did you decide to switch from (your field) to fashion?  
3) How are you going to align your previous education with fashion industry?  
4) How pursuing Master from NIFT will boost your career?  
5) What will you choose if you are selected for both MFM and MFTech(in case you have appeared for both the exams)? Why?  
6) What line of career would you choose after the completion of the course?  
7) Tell about your past experience.  
8) Technical questions from the previous job. 
9) What is one speciality regarding textiles in your native State?  
10) What measures can be taken to improve the scenario of Indian Apparel Industry?  
11) Some other basic questions.

Please note that this list is not exhaustive and I hope to see your comments if
you have more questions similar to those above.  

All the best to all the aspirants.
